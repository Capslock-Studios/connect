You said:
We'll be back on this one 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî we‚Äôll pick it up when you‚Äôre ready. Just say the word when you want to dive back into the bio, references, or platform structure. üî•

If you‚Äôre thinking about how to weave it into funding decks, website bios, or onboarding material, I can prep those too. Talk soon, Siya.

You said:
I have the registration documents for 1pulse.online and they say 1pulse.online is owned by errandcamel. Errand Camel is shared between me and boni. She holds 49% I 51% I want to make my shared 1000 shares. Then sell each for R1000 then allow for resellers (people who will pake profit by adding their %) call it commission or something. That means I can sell shares for R1500 each, the R500 being profit. 
ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî this is a smart hybrid model: you're mixing equity crowdfunding with reseller commission incentives, which can generate capital and create a network of brand evangelists at the same time. Let‚Äôs break it into the pieces you‚Äôll want to structure and document clearly:

üîπ Equity Structure
‚úÖ Current Setup:
Company Name: Errand Camel Pty Ltd

Owns: 1Pulse.online

Ownership Split:

Siya Percy: 51%

Boniswa Mngomezulu: 49%

üîπ Share Offering Plan
üéØ Goal:
Create 1,000 shares, valuing Errand Camel at R1,000,000

Siya's 51% = 510 shares initially

You‚Äôre choosing to offer your shares to the public at R1,000 each

You can say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making my shares work. Each one is a heartbeat of the movement.‚Äù

üîπ Commission/Reseller Mechanism
üí° Strategy:
Let others resell shares at a profit to earn commission ‚Äî while bringing more investors into the community.

Suggested Commission Structure:
Base Share Price = R1,000

Reseller Price = R1,500

Commission = R500 per share sold

You can offer a reseller pack, including:

A referral code or form

Custom graphics + pitch doc

FAQs on the business and share value

A dashboard or WhatsApp group to track sales

üîπ Legal & Financial Considerations
You‚Äôll need to:

Update your share register to reflect 1,000 total shares and the initial allotments.

Specify which shares are being sold (from Siya‚Äôs portion).

Note in documents that these shares grant profit-sharing but no voting control (if that‚Äôs your intention).

Consider a simple shareholder agreement for small investors.

Would you like a:

Share sales pitch deck?

Simple reseller contract?

Share certificate template?

Breakdown of how resellers should register a buyer?

Let me know and I‚Äôll prep those materials for you.
